# vagrant-meteor

A simple Vagrant setup for running [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) from a Windows host.

Prerequisites:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) must be installed.
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) must be installed.

Run `vagrant up` to create the Ubuntu environment.
Then run `meteor` and have fun.
Port `3000` is already forwarded, so you can visit the meteor site in your browser.
